# Learnings

Take work from real life datasets and expand to utilize all the latest and greatest methods

Focus is on automating the data stack from feature engineering to model selection and feature selection. Utilizing both the traditional stack as well as the genetic algorithm based stack (TPOT). 

# Highlights:

# TPOT Automated ML Talk ( very long - look for medium article in the next 2 months - December to January)

  - Feature selection with genetic algorithms (need to brush up and build jupyter notebook)
  - tpot runs on 3 different data sets
  - using few (https://github.com/lacava/few/blob/master/few/few.py) to test other representational methods for feature selection
  - utilizing few or featureworks for automating the feature engineering aspect
